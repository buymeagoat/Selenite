# Purpose
Defines the operating charter for AI collaborators (e.g., Codex) in this repository. Portable across projects; reference at session start.

Read `docs/AI_COLLAB_CHARTER.md` for:
- Role expectations (critical review, communication, scope discipline)
- Process mandates (checkpoints, download policy, fallbacks, admin gating)
- Preferred runners (bootstrap, test harness)
