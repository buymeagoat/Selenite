# Production Readiness Tasks

[Scope] Actionable tasks to close gaps documented in `GAP_ANALYSIS.md`. This file mirrors those IDs, tracks owners/dates/status, and is the only task backlog. Production sign-off lives in `../application_documentation/PRODUCTION_READY.md`.

**Last Updated**: November 25, 2025  
**Current Status**: Increment 19 (E2E Testing) - 96% Complete  
**Target**: Production Deployment Ready

## ⚖️ Process Directives
1. **This document is the canonical backlog.** No engineering work (code, docs, automation, testing) happens unless a task exists here first.
2. **Memorialize every change.** Before starting new work, add/confirm an entry (with owner/date/status). After finishing, update the item with a concise summary and check it off.
3. **Archive all test outputs.** Every time automated or manual tests run, drop the resulting logs/artifacts under `docs/memorialization/test-runs/<timestamp>-<suite>` (use `run-tests.ps1`, or copy artifacts manually if you run ad-hoc commands). This folder is gitignored and serves as the historical log.
4. **Keep every log file.** Backend logging now emits `logs/selenite-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` and `logs/error-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` on each start-never overwrite or delete them unless you're performing an explicit archival process. Review size/retention quarterly per the hygiene policy.
5. **Cross-reference supporting docs.** If the work also touches README, TESTING_PROTOCOL, or other artifacts, note that in the task's description so future readers can reconstruct the history.
6. **Future-scope items stay parked.** Anything marked "Moved to Future Enhancements" remains untouched until re-prioritized here.
7. **Mandate manual evaluation checkpoints.** For substantial changes (e.g., system probe/ASR/diarization/model work), stop after each milestone and perform a manual verification before proceeding; prompt the administrator for these checkpoints in the workflow.

Compliance with these directives is mandatory for humans and AI collaborators alike.

## ♻️ Maintenance Cadence

| ID | Task | Description | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|----|------|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| [HYGIENE-AUDIT] | Repository hygiene audit | Review `repo-hygiene-policy.json` thresholds, prune `logs/` and `docs/memorialization/test-runs` if over limits, confirm automation hooks remain aligned. | Owner | 2026-02-01 (repeats quarterly) | ☐ |

## 🔧 New Work: System Probe, ASR/Diarization Config, Advanced Options

### Implement Now
| ID | Task | Description | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|----|------|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| [SYS-PROBE] | System info probe | Add startup + on-demand probe (OS/container/host, CPU sockets/cores/threads, RAM size/speed, GPU model/VRAM/driver + CUDA/ROCm flag, storage free/used for DB/media/transcripts paths, networking interfaces/IPs/default route, Python/Node versions). Surface via API and admin System Info card with "Detect" refresh. | Owner | 2025-11-30 | TODO |
| [ADMIN-ASR-DIAR] | Admin ASR/diarization settings | Admin toggles: diarization enable, backend select (WhisperX/Pyannote [GPU note]/VAD) with availability; ASR default select; allow-per-job-override flag; runtime fallback to default/viable option on unavailable choice (never fail job). | Owner | 2025-11-30 | TODO |
| [AVAIL-ENDPTS] | Availability reporting | Backend endpoint to report available ASR/diarizer options based on installed deps/models (no downloads). Frontend consumes to drive admin dropdown hints. | Owner | 2025-11-30 | TODO |
| [ADV-OPTIONS-UI] | Advanced options in New Job modal | Add collapsible "Advanced" panel: ASR selector (if admin allows), diarization selector + speaker count (Auto/2-8) gated by admin enable, optional extra flags field (admin-controlled visibility). Default view stays simple. | Owner | 2025-11-30 | TODO |
| [FALLBACK-POLICY] | Runtime fallback | Implement resolver: per-job choice (if allowed) → admin default → next viable; if none, transcribe without diarization; log warnings. Applies to ASR and diarization. | Owner | 2025-11-30 | TODO |
| [DIAR-PIPELINE] | Diarization execution | Wire actual diarization pipeline: run Whisper for ASR + selected diarizer (WhisperX/Pyannote/VAD), respect speaker_count hint (auto/2–8), tag segments/exports with speaker labels, graceful fallback to no labels if backend unavailable. | Owner | 2025-12-07 | TODO |

### Scaffold for Future Implementation
| ID | Task | Description | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|----|------|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| [MODEL-REGISTRY] | Model registry scaffolding | Define schema (in main DB) for model sets/types: provider key, display name, enabled flag, install path, download URL, status, size, checksum, last updated, allow user choice. No download/install yet. | Owner | 2025-12-05 | TODO |
| [MODEL-MGMT-UI] | Model management UI stubs | Admin UI placeholders for listing/editing model sets/types (rename, enable/disable, edit URLs), actions: refresh per model/set/all, re-scan availability. | Owner | 2025-12-05 | TODO |
| [ASR-MULTI] | Multi-ASR adapter | Introduce ASR provider abstraction (e.g., Whisper, HF) with provider/type identifiers, capability metadata, and per-job/admin resolution flow (choice → default → fallback). No additional providers wired yet. | Owner | 2025-12-05 | TODO |

### Defer (Feasible Later)
| ID | Task | Description | Notes |
|----|------|-------------|-------|
| [MODEL-DL] | Model download/install flows | Admin-triggered downloads with progress/checksums/disk checks; "cached only" vs "fetch on use" (warned). |
| [EXTRA-ASR] | Additional ASR providers | Add adapters for HF/local models/external APIs; expose via registry. |
| [SMART/IO] | Disk SMART/I/O checks | Optional health and perf sampling beyond free/used metrics. |
| [AUTO-RECO] | Automated default recommendation | Use probe data to auto-suggest defaults; admin can override. |

## ✅ MVP Definition
- User can upload audio, trigger transcription, view job details, and export transcripts.
- Basic job management available (delete, restart) and basic tagging (assign/remove existing tags).
- App runs reliably on a single machine with sensible defaults and basic security (rate limiting, input validation).
- A manual smoke test passes end-to-end; optional E2E automation can follow post-MVP.

## 🔗 MVP Task Chain (Ordered)
1) Manual smoke-test pass for core workflow (Login → Upload → Process → View → Export) using `docs/build/testing/SMOKE_TEST.md`.
2) Frontend wiring completeness for core actions:
	- Confirm download, restart, delete, and tag assignment function against live API.
3) Address any P0 issues uncovered by the smoke test (stability and error UX for core paths).
4) Security hardening verification (rate limiting, validation, headers) — already implemented; verify via quick checks.
5) Minimal packaging/readiness: ensure health check, logging, and configuration are in place (already implemented).
6) Update `./testing/E2E_TEST_REPORT.md` with a short note or perform a minimal E2E sanity (optional for MVP, recommended next).

## 📝 Notes

- **Single-User Focus**: This is a desktop application for a single user. Multi-user features are explicitly out of scope.
- **Local Processing**: All transcription happens locally using Whisper models. No cloud dependencies.
- **SQLite Database**: Sufficient for single-user workload; no need for PostgreSQL.
- **Security Scope**: Focus on preventing common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, path traversal), but not enterprise-grade multi-tenant security.
- **Test Coverage**: Backend at 100% for implemented features; E2E at 90.6% and improving.

---
